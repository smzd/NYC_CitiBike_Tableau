This project aims for potential investors who might approve seed funding for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. To do so, we started our research by looking into New York City CitiBike dataset from the Citibike website. To analyze the bike sharing program in NYC. New York City and Iowa's population and tourism might not be the same. However, using New York City data helped us to examine and be resourceful for the bike sharing program for Des Moines better. Hence we created an impactful proposal for our bike sharing program based in Iowa.

                                            ##Results

As we can see, there are a total number of 2,344,224 individuals who utilized the bike sharing program. 1,90,359 of them are subscribers, and 443,865 are customers. When we dig into more profound and study gender breakdown, we see a significant portion of the users are male.

We see a heavy concentration of bike usage between Midtown and to Financial District, which can be either for work or tourism reasons.

After 5 mins, the trip duration drops drastically. As the trip duration goes further and gets closer to 1 hour, the number of bike usage drops to less than a thousand. This helps us determine the bike-sharing program’s time and rental charge.

We can see bike usage between male, female and unknown with the same trip duration. To recognize which gender uses more of this rental program. Based on the graph, we can depict that after one hour, all gender have similar checkout times. This helps us to analyze which gender demographic we need to focus on boosting the business.

The Heatmap depicts that the bike-sharing program's time of the week is more popular. Peak hours are Monday-Fri 8 am and 5-6 pm on weekends.

We also analyzed the heatmap gender-based. To study peak hours for different gender demographic.

The last heatmap shows a difference between customer and subscriber trips based on gender and demographic. From the map, there are more male than female customers and subscribers.  Also, the total number of subscribers is more than one-time rent customers. This leads us to believe locals are using more than tourists in NYC.

                                                #Summary
Based on our visualization, we can summarize: 

•	We analyzed customer and subscriber data and concluded that over 81% of the users have subscriptions to bike rentals. Also, the majority of the users are male.

•	Rentals are more concentrated in the working (i.e., offices) and tourism areas. 

•	The duration of riding bikes decreases when time increases. This means users don’t use it for long-distance rides.

For further analysis, I would suggest studying bike sharing in all seasons. We demonstrated that the bike rental business is perfect during the month of August (summer). However, we need to consider fall, winter, and spring.

We also need to consider the revenue bike rental generates, repair costs, and upkeep every season. To see whether it is a profitable business to invest in. How often do bikes need to be replaced, and how long will it take to become profitable?
